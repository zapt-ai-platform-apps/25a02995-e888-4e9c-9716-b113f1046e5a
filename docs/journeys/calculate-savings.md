# Calculate Savings

Follow these steps to run your energy savings calculations:

1. After entering your energy data, click on the **Calculate Savings** button.
2. The app will display a loading state labeled **Calculating...** to let you know that the calculations are in progress.
3. Once the process completes, the calculator will provide separate results for solar and wind energy estimates including the number of panels or turbines needed, installation costs, estimated monthly savings, and the payback period.
4. If an error occurs (for instance, due to missing or invalid data), a clear error message will be shown.
